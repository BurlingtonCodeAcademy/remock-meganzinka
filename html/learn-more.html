        <h4>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing</h4>
        <p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Think about a cloud.
          Just float around and be there. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. There's not a thing in
          the world wrong with washing your brush. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let's make some happy little clouds
          in our world. Trees grow however makes them happy. What the devil.</p>

        <p>I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate
          things. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Just think about these things in your mind and
          drop em' on canvas. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. From all of us
          here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Just beat the devil out of it. You don't
          have to be crazy to do this but it does help.</p>

        <h4>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.</h4>
        <p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or
          worrying. Here we're limited by the time we have. Let's build an almighty mountain. You don't want to kill all
          your dark areas they are very important. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Be brave.
          Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of
          Sap Green. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You can spend all day playing with mountains. With practice
          comes confidence.</p>

        <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can
          move mountains. You can do anything. Poor old tree. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole
          community fantastic dividends. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Even the worst thing we can do
          here is good. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You have to allow the
          paint to break to make it beautiful. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>
        <h4>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.</h4>
        <p>Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Let's put some happy little clouds in our
          world. In your world you can create anything you desire. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all
          the little creatures in nature. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do
          anything. Every time you practice, you learn more. Every single thing in the world has its own personality -
          and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

        <p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. You
          need the dark in order to show the light. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have
          that power. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Anytime you learn something your time and
          energy are not wasted. It's cold, but it's beautiful. It's so important to do something every day that will
          make you happy. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
          Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.</p>

          <p class="float-text">We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. If we're
            gonna walk
            though
            the woods, we need a
            little path. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. All those
            little
            son
            of a guns. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper
            floating
            across a mountain.</p>

            while using no pressure at
            all. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Just make
            little
            strokes like that. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>
