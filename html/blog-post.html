      <h4>Yeah, that's basically it</h4>
      <p>No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our
        imagination. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Once you learn the technique, ohhh!
        Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community
        fantastic dividends. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Just relax and let it flow. That
        easy. Brown is such a nice color.</p>
      <p>
        We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You have freedom
        here. The only guide is your heart. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever
        it takes. That's crazy. We need dark in order to show light. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a
        friend.
      </p>
      <h4>The least little bit can do so much. Take your time. Speed will come later.</h4>
      <p>
        When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done
        anything to it yet. We'll do another happy little painting. You want your tree to have some character. Make it
        special. In this world, everything can be happy. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Let's build
        an almighty mountain. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and
        get your floor wet. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
