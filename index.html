        <h4>This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</h4>
        <div class="border-below">
          <p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. It's all a game of angles.
            If you do too much
            it's
            going to lose its effectiveness. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can
            do.

            We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You create
            the
            dream - then you bring it into your world. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

            I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.
            Let's
            go
            up in here, and start having some fun The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it
            finished
            in your mind before you ever start. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Everybody's
            different.
            Trees
            are different. Let them all be individuals.

        <h4>The least little bit can do so much.</h4>

        <p>Very easy to work these to death. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You
          can get away with a lot. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. It's important to me that you're
          happy. You've got
          to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. I'm going to mix up a little
          color.
          We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Mountains are so simple, they're
          hard.
          Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your
          time
          thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

          Let the paint work. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is
          perfect.
          Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? How do you make a round circle with a
          square
          knife? That's your challenge for the day. Those great big fluffy clouds. Remember how free clouds are. They
          just
          lay
          around in the sky all day long. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.

            the woods, we need a
            little path. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. All those
            little
            son
            of a guns. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper
