      <h6>Right is Also Not Left</h6>
      <p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. It's all a game of angles. If you do too much
        it's
        going to lose its effectiveness. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.

        We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You create the
        dream - then you bring it into your world. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

        I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Let's
        go
        up in here, and start having some fun The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it
        finished
        in your mind before you ever start. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Everybody's different.
        Trees
        are different. Let them all be individuals.</p>

      <h6>The least little bit can do so much.</h6>
      <p>Very easy to work these to death. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You can
        get
        away with a lot. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. It's important to me that you're happy. You've
        got
        to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. I'm going to mix up a little
        color.
        We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Mountains are so simple, they're
        hard.
        Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your
        time
        thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

        Let the paint work. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is
        perfect.
        Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? How do you make a round circle with a
        square
        knife? That's your challenge for the day. Those great big fluffy clouds. Remember how free clouds are. They just
        lay
        around in the sky all day long. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.</p>

      <h6>Let's build some happy little clouds up here.</h6>
      <p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Work that
        paint.
        Let's get crazy. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get
        better. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Anything you want to do you can do
        here.
        A beautiful little sunset. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.

        It all happens automatically. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Don't fight it, use what
        happens.
        Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. You have to make those little noises or it
        won't
        work. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Paint anything you want on
        the
        canvas. Create your own world. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.

      <h6>Just Another Post</h6>
      <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. You
        have to
        make those little noises or it won't work.</p>

      <h6>And Another Post</h6>
      <p>You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Let's have a little bit of fun
        today. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.</p>

      <h6>One More Post</h6>
      <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy,
        it
        always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>

      <p class="float-text">We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. If we're gonna walk though
        the woods, we need a
        little path. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. All those little
        son
        of a guns. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper
        floating
        across a mountain.</p>

      <p class="float-text">There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We want to use a lot pressure
        while using no pressure at
        all. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Just make little
        strokes like that. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>
